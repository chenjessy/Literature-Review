This paper bridges the gap in the literature about institutions since little attention has been paid to the role of power structures beyond the state-cosiety balance.

The three players in the model:
* the Ruler, the emperor or king
* the Elites, primarily the lords in Europe and the bureaucrats in China
* the common people

The two dimensions in the model:
* the degree of asymmetry between the Elites and People in terms of their everyday power and rights. The definition of this dimension is how social surplus is distributed between them.
* The Ruler's absolute power over the ruled. The concept of this dimension is the degree of punishment of the ruled if they defy the Ruler.

These definitions are related to the neo-Roman theory of liberty, which is shocking to me, that is, there is liberty only when there is no possibility for one's civil rights to be dependent on the goodwill of someone else.

They construct a simple game theory model. 
* There is a Ruler, who prefers to maintain a particular status quo of autocratic rule.
* And there is a Challenger, who try to alter it. It can be external threat, a conspiriing elite, or a rebellious domestic population. Can be armed or no-violent.

Definition of the absolute power of the Ruler: the conditionality of the payoffs to the ruled if they submit to the Ruler's will.
* Punishment effect: the greater the payoff the People enjoy when they submit to the Ruler's will, the more they will lose if they defy, so they will be loyal.
* Political alliance effect: Knowing that a stronger alliance between the Ruler and People worsens the prospect of a challenge to the Ruler, the Elites will be more willing to side with the Ruler too.--this creates an incentive for the Ruler to promote a more symmetric Elite-People relationship.

They build a dynamic model by allowing the current political stability resulting from the existing power structure to influence the future power structure, which suggests that if there are multiple steady states, then two societies that differ slightly in their power structure may diverge toward two different steady states, each following the same institutional compatibility, where one steady state has stronger absolute power of the Ruler, a more symmetric Elite-People relationship, and greater stability of autocratic rule. 
* The initial conditions and the potential path dependence in the evolution of power structures are important.
