The image below shows the trend of how several ways are used in the papers in the economics and management fields. From 2015 to now, the number of papers using DID has increased a lot.

The reason why DID is popular in recent years is that it's a very straightforward way of extracting the causal effect by identifying the difference in effects on the individuals of the treatment group and the control group. The core is that there is an interaction term to identify the average treatment effect on the treated, which is called ATT. Or to be rigorous, the ATT at the post-treatment period.

1. Basic setup of DID model:

$Y_{it} = \alpha + \delta D_i + \lambda T_t + \beta(D_i \times T_t) + \epsilon_{it}$, $Y_{it}$: the outcome variable, $D_i$: dummy variable of group (treatment or control), $T_t$: dummy variable of policy time (pre or post), $D_i \times T_t$: interaction term, $\beta$: the coefficient for causal effect.

In reality, DID often applied in the analysis of panel data, so TWFE model is used. DID takes the following form when using TWFE:

$Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta (D_i \times T_t) + \mu_i +\gamma_t+\epsilon_{it}$

It takes this form because when there are individual fixed effects and time fixed effects, there will be a multicollinearity problem if the variable of the group is added.

2. Other forms of DID setups

2.1 staggered DID

The standard DID model and the TWFE model assume that the policy shock happens at the same period for all individuals. But in reality, this might not be true. So this provides the opportunity to use staggered DID. in this model, the dummy variable for groups changes from $D_i$ to $D_{it}$, and there needs interaction term no more as it already signal whether individual i is shocked by the policy at time t.

2.2 generalized DID

When all individuals are affected, there is no control group, but we can use the treatment intensity to do DID analysis. The dummy variable of group is now changed to a continuous variable to signal how largely the individual is affected (Nunn N., Qian N., “The potato’s contribution to population and urbanization: evidence from a historical experiment”,  The quarterly journal of economics, 2011, 126(2): 593-650.).

2.3 cohort DID

Use cross-sectional data to identify the effect of a historical event on one individual. The first difference is the difference in regions. The second difference is the difference in cohort. The core of cohort DID is to use the individuals in the unaffected cohort as a control group for the individuals in the affected cohort (*Duflo E., “Schooling and labor market consequences of school construction in Indonesia: Evidence from an unusual  policy experiment”, American economic review, 2001, 91(4): 795-813. *Chen Y., Fan Z., Gu X., et al., “Arrival of young talent: The send-down movement and rural education in China”,  American Economic Review, 2020, 110(11): 3393-3430.).

2.4 fuzzy DID

When there is no clean treatment group and no clean control group, use the fuzzy DID design (De Chaisemartin, C., d’Haultfoeuille X., “Fuzzy differences-in-differences”, The Review of Economic Studies, 2018,  85(2), 999-1028.).

2.5 triple DID
