This paper uses an innovative method, conditional on quality, exporters may price discriminate and set higher markups and higher prices in more distant countries.

Two traditional explanations of why the markups are higher for exporting goods to more distant destination countries:
1. Composition effect: per-unit trade costs can lower the relative price, and increase the relative demand for higher-quality goods in more distant countries.
2. Selection effect (quality sorting): firms choose to export high-quality varieties to more distant markets only.

This paper uses the wine data, and the quality measure of wines, which can help them to decompose the distance elasticity of export unit values into markups and quality.
