This is a document explaining the importance of institutions in shaping different economic outcomes. The authors' are well-known economists, but their tones of telling stories in this paper are more like political scientist.

The authors first document the empirical importance of institutions by using two quasi-natural experiments: the division of Korea into two parts and the colonization of much of the world by European powers. In the model, the two state variables are political institutions and the distribution of resources.

When thinking about growth, the differences in growth rate across countries are important. Some recent contributions focus on economic policies, such as taxes, subsidies, barriers to technology adoption, and human capital policies. But they don't give an explanation for the differences across countries.

Question: Why are some countries much poorer than others?
* Traditional answer by the neoclassical growth models: saving rates (Solow), preferences (RCK), or other factors like TFP growth (endogenous growth theories). But even the most recent development in the growth models like the Romer(1990), although they endogenize steady-state growth and technical progress, the explanations are quite similar to the old theories: the country should allocate more resources to innovation.
* This paper needs to explain the differences in income and growth by variations in institutions, which were well defined and homogeneous, like the property rights, and exchange goods and services in markets, in the traditional models.

——The factors we have listed (innovation, economies of scale, education, capital accumulation, etc.) are not causes of growth; they are growth. (North and Thomas 1973)

Definition of institutions: Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction.

The importance of institutions: In consequence, they structure incentives in human exchange, whether political, social, or economic.

Institutions are broadly endogenous, at least in part determined by society, or a segment of it. But we lack the crucial comparative statics for explaining why equilibrium economic institutions differ. That's why studies on institutions in economics were neglected.

1.2 The argument

* Economic institutions matter for economic growth, as they influence not only the size of the aggregate pie, but how this pie is divided among different groups and individuals.
* Economic institutions are endogenous and determined as a collective choice of the society. Political power is the ultimate arbiter in the game between groups with opposing preferences.
* Commitment problems, individuals who have political power cannot commit not to use it in their best interests, which causes inefficiencies.
* Two types of political power: de jure (institutional) & de facto. The political institutions decide the de jure political power. With different institutions, the constraints on exercise are different. And the distribution of resources determines the de facto political power, which can be seen as the ability of solving the collective action problem.
* a hierarchy of institutions: political institutions->equilibrium economic institutions->economic outcomes.
* Political power influences the evolution of political institutions, as they will choose to maintain the political institutions that give them political power. But de facto political power occasionally creates changes in political institutions.

Example for institution change: Civil war of 1642 and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England. Dutch Revolt in the Netherlands. The land market and trade help merchants and gentry accumulate the fortune to feed the army. But two key questions: There are conflicts between the monarchy and the merchants. But why does the monarchy not set up secure property rights to encourage economic growth and tax some of the benefits? Why did the merchants and gentry use their de facto political power to change political institutions rather than just implement the policies they wanted?-——commitment

Definition of good economic institutions: provide secure property rights for a broad cross-section of society.

2. Fundamental causes of income differences
   
   2.1 Three fundamental causes
   
   2.1.1 Economic institutions: consist of an interrelated cluster of things. Enforcement of property rights for a broad cross-section of society. And some degree of equality of opportunity in society.
   * stable property rights
   * perfection and spread of markets
   * political economy-redistributive effects
     
   2.1.2 Geography: nature that determines both the preferences and the opportunity set
   * climate-work effort, incentives, productivity
   * geography-technology available to a society, especially in agriculture. same as Diamond (1997).
   * disease burden
   2.1.3 Culture: different shared experiences or different religions. determine values, preferences, and beliefs.
   * influence equilibrium outcomes for a given set of institutions.
   * link between religions and development-weber(1930) about the Protestant Reformation and the rise of Calvinism, emphasizes hard work, thrift, and saving.
   * particular cultural endowments-Banfield (1958), poverty of southern Italy due to the fact that people adopt a culture of "amoral familiarism"

Two problems: reverse causality and omitted variable bias.

  3.1 The Korean experiment
  Both countries share the same geographic possibilities in terms of access to markets and the cost of transportation. And at the time of separation, North and South Korea had the same income per capita. So any differences in economic performance can plausibly be attributed to differences in institutions.

  By the 1980s, the communist economic policies in North Korea were not working. The continued efforts of the leadership to cling to these policies and to power can only be explained by those leaders wishing to look after their own interests at the expense of the population at large.

  3.2 The colonial experiment
  The reversal of fortune trend:

  But before 1500, when European colonization had no effect on any of these societies, the relationships for urbanization plotting separately the relationship between urbanization in 1000 and in 1500 for the samples of these countries. Both figures show persistence, not reversal.

  The previously-poor colonies surpassed the former highly-urbanized colonies starting in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centries, went hand in hand with industrialization. There was more industry in India in 1750 than in the US. By 1860, the US and British colonies with relatively good economic institutions began to move ahead rapidly, and by 1953, a huge gap had opened up.

  Other things equal, the higher the initial population density or the greater initial urbanization, the worse were subsequent institutions. In densely-settled and relatively-developed places, the Europeans are interested in extracting the resources rather than respecting the property rights of the majority.

  They conclude that economic institutions are more important when there are major new investment opportunities.

  In places with a large indigenous population, Europeans could exploit the population, be it in the form of taxes, tributes or employment as forced labor in mines or plantations. A more developed civilization and a denser population structure made it more profitable for the Europeans to introduce worse economic institutions. In contrtast, in places with little to extract, and in sparsely-settled places and low urbanization areas, where the Europeans themselves became the majority of the population, it was in their interests to introduce economic institutions protecting their own property rights.

  IV: disease environment 200 or more years ago (mortality rates, Curtin(1989,1998) & Gutierrez (1986)), which affects outcomes today only through its effect on institutions today. A bivariate regression has an $R^2$ of 0.26, which shows that there were very large differences in European mortality. If two countries both lie on the regression line, then almost the entire difference in incomes per capita between them can be explained by the differences in the security of property rights.

  The disease environment also explains why there are strong correlations between geographical variables such as latitude and income per capita. Europeans did not have immunity to tropical diseases during the colonial period, so the settler colonies tended to be created in the temperate latitudes. Once economic institutions are properly controlled for, these relationships go away. There is no causal effect of geography on prosperity today, though it may have been important historically in shaping economic institutions. Also for culture, once they control properly for the effects of economic institutions, neither the identity of the colonial power, nor the contemporary fraction of Europeans in the population, nor the proportions of the populations of various religions, nor the presence of Europeans, are significant determinants of income per capita (2001). So it is the institutions that cause the income differences and long-run growth.

5. Why do institutions differ
   5.1 The efficient institutions view - Political Coase Theorem
   By the Political Coase Theorem (Acemoglu (2003)), economic institutions are chosen efficiently, so economic institutions cannot be the fundamental cause of income differences. Efficiency arises because individuals ultimately calculate according to social costs and benefits. The only way of rationalize these differences is to think of economic institutions varying for reasons other than the underlying needs of societies.
   5.2 The ideology view- Modified Political Coase Theorem
   If different societies have different beliefs about what is socially efficient, they can rationally choose different economic institutions. But can differences in beliefs explain the differences between South and North Korea? Maybe. But by the 1980s, it was clear that the communist economic policies in the North were not working. The continued effort of the leadership to cling to these policies and power can only be explained by leaders looking after their own interests at the expense of the population at large. The conclusion is that ideology often plays important roles, but the authors don't believe that a satisfactory theory of institutional differences can be founded on differences in ideology.
   5.3 The incidental institutions view
   Instead of thinking of institutions as choices, they can be the by-product or unintended consequence of other social interactions or historical accidents.
   Democracy emerged with a strong middle class since agriculture had been commercialized. Facism arose since there were weak middle classes and they coalesce with landowners. The Communist Revolution emerged when there was no middle class or commercialized agriculture.
   From this view, it explains why there is possibility that a society may end up with institutions that do not maximize income or growth.
   Resource allocation is also a concern. Legal origins are also historical accidents, mostly related to the incidence of European colonialism.
   The authors do not think accidents can fully explain the differences in institutions because the accidents can not explain why these institutions are persistent.
   5.4 The social conflict view
   Economic and political institutions are not always chosen by the whole society and not for the benefit of the whole society, but by the groups that control political power at the time, perhaps as a result of conflict with other groups. In other words, equilibrium economic institutions will not be those that maximize the size of the overall pie, but the slice of the pie taken by the powerful groups.
   North (1981) argued in "A Neoclassical Theory of the State" that the agents who controlled the state should be modeled as self-interested. The set of property rights that they would choose for society would be those that maximize their payoff, and because of "transaction costs", these would not necessarily be the set that maximized social welfare. The authors here argue that commitment problems are the transaction costs that are at the root of the divergence.
   The difference between the social conflict view and
   *ideological view: social conflict can lead to choices of economic institutions which cause underdevelopment even when all agents have common knowledge that this is so.
   *incidental view: institutional choices that cause underdevelopment are conscious choices.
   *efficient view: it doesn't assume that institutions are always efficient.
   
6. Sources of inefficiencies
   Commitment problems: When the problem comes to institutional choices, there is no impartial third party that can be trusted to enforce contracts. This is the origin of the commitment problem in politics.
   As long as there is a dictatorship, there is no higher authority to make the dictator stick to his promise.
   6.1 Hold-up
   With hold-up problems, there are no secure property rights for groups without political power. Without such protection, productive investments are not undertaken, and opportunities for economic growth go unexploited.
   6.2 Political losers
   The political elite evaluate every potential economic change not only by its economic consequences, such as growth and distribution, but also by its political consequences. Any economic change that will erode the elite's political power is likely to reduce their economic rents in the long run.
   The fear of losing political power can lead various groups of political and economic elites to oppose institutional change and also the introduction of new technologies. 
   6.3 Economic losers
   A move from a bad to a better set of economic institutions will make some people or groups worse off, and will not be Pareto improving. Such groups will have an incentive to block or impede such institutional changes even if they benefit the whole society in some aggregate sense.
   This can be seen earliest in trade literature: Individuals invested in sectors in which an economy does not enjoy a comparative advantage will lose economically from free trade.
   This problem is also due to commitment.
   Economic losers vs. political losers, which is worse? If institutional change hurts the political elites' rents, why don't they use political power to redistribute the aggregate gain brought by the institutional change? It must be that these groups of elites losing economically also experience a reduction in their political power, making redistribution impossible. So problems of political losers are more important than economic losers.
   6.4  The inseparability of efficiency and distribution
