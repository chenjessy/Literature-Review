The authors first document the empirical importance of institutions by using two quasi-natural experiments: the division of Korea into two parts and the colonization of much of the world by European powers. In the model, the twop state variables are political institutions and the distribution of resources.

Question: Why are some countries much poorer than others?
Traditional answer by the neoclassical growth models: saving rates (Solow), preferences (RCK), or other factors like TFP growth (endogeneous growth theories)
This paper: need to explain the differences in income and growth by variations in institutions, which were well defined and homogeneous, like the property rights, and exchange goods and services in markets, in the traditional models.
