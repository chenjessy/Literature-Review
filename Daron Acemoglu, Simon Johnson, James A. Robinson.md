The authors first document the empirical importance of institutions by using two quasi-natural experiments: the division of Korea into two parts and the colonization of much of the world by European powers. In the model, the two state variables are political institutions and the distribution of resources.

When thinking about growth, the differences in growth rate across countries are important. Some recent contributions focus on economic policies, such as taxes, subsidies, barriers to technology adoption, and human capital policies. But they don't give an explanation for the differences across countries.

Question: Why are some countries much poorer than others?
* Traditional answer by the neoclassical growth models: saving rates (Solow), preferences (RCK), or other factors like TFP growth (endogenous growth theories). But even the most recent development in the growth models like the Romer(1990), although they endogenize steady-state growth and technical progress, the explanations are quite similar to the old theories: the country should allocate more resources to innovation.
* This paper needs to explain the differences in income and growth by variations in institutions, which were well defined and homogeneous, like the property rights, and exchange goods and services in markets, in the traditional models.

——The factors we have listed (innovation, economies of scale, education, capital accumulation, etc.) are not causes of growth; they are growth. (North and Thomas 1973)

Definition of institutions: Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction.

The importance of institutions: In consequence, they structure incentives in human exchange, whether political, social, or economic.

Institutions are broadly endogenous, at least in part determined by society, or a segment of it. But we lack the crucial comparative statics for explaining why equilibrium economic institutions differ. That's why studies on institutions in economics were neglected.

1.2 The argument

* Economic institutions matter for economic growth, as they influence not only the size of the aggregate pie, but how this pie is divided among different groups and individuals.
* Economic institutions are endogenous and determined as a collective choice of the society. Political power is the ultimate arbiter in the game between groups with opposing preferences.
* Commitment problems, individuals who have political power cannot commit not to use it in their best interests, which causes inefficiencies.
* Two types of political power: de jure (institutional) & de facto. The political institutions decide the de jure political power. With different institutions, the constraints on exercise are different. And the distribution of resources determines the de facto political power, which can be seen as the ability of solving the collective action problem.
* a hierarchy of institutions: political institutions->equilibrium economic institutions->economic outcomes.
* Political power influences the evolution of political institutions, as they will choose to maintain the political institutions that give them political power. But de facto political power occasionally creates changes in political institutions.
