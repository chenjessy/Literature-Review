When the US-China trade war happened in 2018-2019, there are more government VC funds sustained their investments in manufacturing industries targeted by the US tariffs. This is a special industrial policy which helped underpin the resilience of China's high-tech industries when facing the geopolitical tensions. The main findings are that for the startups heavily exposed to tariff shocks, they are more likely to secure follow-on financing from government VC, especially if they had stronger innovation track records. Also these firms tend to produced more patents if their localities had higher ex ante government VC activity.
