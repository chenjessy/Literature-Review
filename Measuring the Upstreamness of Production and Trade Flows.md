A very innovative paper born at the age of the gradual popularity of using Input-Output Tables. Not only focusing on one country and several industries, but also extracting all the data can be used to make the conclusion robust. Big questions and the solutions that can be applied everywhere are always inspiring.

They propose two ways of measuring the upstreamness of industries, which give similar results. Reasonable interpretations are also given. They empirically test the measurements using the 2002 US IO Tables for 426 industries. Verification is also given by testing using the OECD STAN database across countries. They also give the determinants of the average upstreamness of exports at the country level, like the country institutions pertaining to the rule of law and financial development, and factor endowments.
