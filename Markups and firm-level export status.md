This paper shows that based on revenue data, only the level of markup is potentially affected but not the estimate of the correlation between markups and firm-level characteristics or how markups change over time.

They use the empirical model to verify whether exporters charge higher markups than their domestic counterparts in the same industry, and how markups change upon export entry.
