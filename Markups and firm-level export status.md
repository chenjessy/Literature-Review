This paper shows that, based on revenue data, only the level of markup is potentially affected but not the estimate of the correlation between markups and firm-level characteristics or how markups change over time.

They use the empirical model to verify whether exporters charge higher markups than their domestic counterparts in the same industry, and how markups change upon export entry.

1. Recovering markups from production data
   Robert Hall(1986, 1988, 1990) suggests that industry-specific markups can be generated from production data with information on firm- or industry-level usage of inputs and total value of shipments. This approach is based on the production function framework, using the notion that under imperfect competition, input growth is associated with disproportional output growth. A markup higher than one can reject the perfect competitive model.
   According to the literature, the correlation between productivity and export status has been proven to be robust. There are strong self-selection effects of firms into the export markets based on an underlying productivity distribution.
   This paper also explores the dynamics of export entry and exit to analyze how it impacts markups. They also discussed the learning by exporting hypothesis, which is the significant productivity improvements for exporters upon export entry.
